# Rename Modules 1 to 3 with Category Labels

## Context
User requested to rename the module directories for "01-ros2-fundamentals", "02-digital-twin", and "03-isaac-platform" to reflect the labels defined in their respective `_category_.json` files.

## Changes
-   **Renamed `docs/01-ros2-fundamentals` to `docs/Module-1-The-Robotic-Nervous-System-ROS-2`.**
-   **Renamed `docs/02-digital-twin` to `docs/Module-2-The-Digital-Twin-Gazebo-Unity`.**
-   **Renamed `docs/03-isaac-platform` to `docs/Module-3-The-AI-Robot-Brain-NVIDIA-Isaac`.**
-   File contents within these directories were not altered.

## Rationale
-   Aligns directory names with the user-preferred display labels from `_category_.json`.
-   Sanitized directory names (e.g., replacing colons, parentheses, and spaces with hyphens) to ensure compatibility with Windows file systems.
-   The Docusaurus autogenerated sidebar will now display these modules with their new directory names (which match the `_category_.json` labels), maintaining their relative order due to the `position` specified in `_category_.json` files.
