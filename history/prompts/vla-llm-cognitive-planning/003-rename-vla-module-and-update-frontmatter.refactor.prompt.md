# Rename VLA Module and Update Frontmatter

## Context
User requested to rename the "04-vla" module and its contained file "01_llm_cognitive_planning.md" to more descriptive names with specific frontmatter updates.

## Changes
1.  **Created Directory**: `docs/Module-4-Vision-Language-Action` (Sanitized from "Module-4:Vision Language Action").
2.  **Created File**: `Week-5-LLM-Cognitive-Planning.md` with original content + new frontmatter.
3.  **Removed**: Old directory `docs/04-vla`.

## Rationale
-   Colons (`:`) are not valid in Windows filenames, so they were replaced with hyphens (`-`).
-   Frontmatter updated to support Docusaurus routing and display titles.
