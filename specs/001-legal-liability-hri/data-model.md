# Data Model: Week 9 Legal Liability (ELSI)

## Learning Object (Chapter Structure)

### 1. Introduction: The Evolving Legal Landscape of Humanoids
*   **Goal**: Briefly introduce the growing importance of legal and privacy considerations for autonomous humanoids.
*   **Key Concept**: The gap between existing law and emerging robotic capabilities.

### 2. Legal Accountability for Autonomous Humanoids
*   **Learning Goal**: Understand the challenges in assigning legal responsibility for robot-induced damage.
*   **Sub-sections**:
    *   **2.1. Traditional Liability Regimes**: Product liability, negligence, strict liability (brief overview).
    *   **2.2. The Blame Game**: Manufacturer vs. programmer vs. owner vs. operator vs. AI system itself.
    *   **2.3. The "Black Box" Problem**: How AI's opacity complicates accountability.
    *   **2.4. Emerging Legal Debates**: Discussions around new legal categories (e.g., electronic personhood, AI as a responsible agent).

### 3. Privacy and Data Governance for High-Fidelity Sensors
*   **Learning Goal**: Address privacy concerns and best practices for data handling from humanoid sensors.
*   **Sub-sections**:
    *   **3.1. Sensors as Surveillance**: Vision (facial recognition, identity inference), Voice (conversations, biometrics), LiDAR (personal space, activity patterns).
    *   **3.2. Data Lifecycle Challenges**:
        *   **Collection**: Scope, necessity, consent mechanisms.
        *   **Storage & Use**: Security, anonymization, secondary uses.
        *   **Sharing & Deletion**: Third-party access, data retention policies, right to be forgotten.
    *   **3.3. Regulatory Context**: GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) - key principles and applicability.
    *   **3.4. Privacy-by-Design Principles**: Strategies for embedding privacy from the outset.

### 4. Explainable AI (XAI) for Ethical and Legal Deployment
*   **Learning Goal**: Recognize the role of explainability in fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and enabling ethical decision-making.
*   **Sub-sections**:
    *   **4.1. The Need for Explainability**: Trust, auditability, debugging, compliance.
    *   **4.2. Defining XAI for Robotics**: Interpretability vs. Explainability, local vs. global explanations.
    *   **4.3. XAI Techniques (Overview)**: SHAP, LIME, counterfactual explanations (briefly).
    *   **4.4. XAI and Legal Compliance**: How explanations can support burden of proof and accountability.

## Entities
*   **Autonomous Humanoid**: A robot capable of operating independently.
*   **Legal Personhood**: The quality of being a subject of legal rights and duties.
*   **Personal Data**: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
*   **Consent**: Freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Methods and techniques that make AI systems understandable to humans.
