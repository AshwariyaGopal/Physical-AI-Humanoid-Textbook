# Research & Content Strategy: Legal Liability, Privacy, and Explainability in HRI

## Content Decisions

### 1. Learning Goals
*   **Decision**: Frame the learning goals directly from the Success Criteria outlined in `spec.md`.
*   **Key Concepts to Cover**: Legal challenges, privacy regulations, XAI importance.

### 2. The Accountability Problem
*   **Decision**: Explore the complexities of assigning liability in cases of autonomous humanoid-induced damage.
*   **Key Concepts to Cover**:
    *   Traditional Legal Concepts: Product liability, negligence.
    *   Challenged Roles: Manufacturer, programmer, owner, operator.
    *   The "Black Box" Problem: Difficulty in determining intent or cause in AI decisions.
    *   Emerging Legal Frameworks: EU's proposed AI liability rules (brief mention).

### 3. Privacy Challenges
*   **Decision**: Detail the privacy implications of high-fidelity sensors and relevant data governance.
*   **Key Concepts to Cover**:
    *   High-Fidelity Sensors: Vision (facial recognition, surveillance), Voice (biometrics, conversations), LiDAR (environmental mapping).
    *   Data Lifecycle: Collection, storage, processing, sharing, deletion.
    *   Regulations: GDPR, CCPA (context and relevance).
    *   Mitigation Strategies: Privacy-by-design, anonymization, explicit consent, secure data storage.

### 4. Explainable AI (XAI) in Robotics
*   **Decision**: Emphasize XAI's role in ethical deployment, trust, and legal compliance.
*   **Key Concepts to Cover**:
    *   Definition of XAI: Making AI decisions understandable to humans.
    *   Importance: Trust, debugging, legal compliance, ethical oversight.
    *   Challenges: Complexity of deep learning models.
    *   Techniques (brief mention): SHAP, LIME, counterfactual explanations.
    *   Connection to Accountability: XAI helps in post-incident analysis.

## Technical Context (Documentation)
*   **Platform**: Docusaurus (Markdown/MDX).
*   **Target Audience**: Robotics researchers, engineers, legal professionals, ethicists.
*   **Purpose**: Educate on legal and ethical considerations in humanoid robotics.
