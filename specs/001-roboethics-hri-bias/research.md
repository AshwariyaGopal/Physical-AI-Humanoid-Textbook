# Research & Content Strategy: Roboethics, HRI, and Bias

## Content Decisions

### 1. Learning Goals
*   **Decision**: Frame the learning goals directly from the Success Criteria outlined in `spec.md`.
*   **Key Concepts to Cover**: Definitions, explanations, and practical implications of each topic.

### 2. Psychological Impact (Uncanny Valley)
*   **Decision**: Provide clear definitions and visual examples (e.g., using a diagram or descriptive text for the uncanny valley curve).
*   **Key Concepts to Cover**:
    *   Anthropomorphism: Definition, types (physical, behavioral).
    *   Uncanny Valley: Definition, psychological basis, impact on HRI (acceptance, trust).
    *   Design implications: How to avoid or navigate the uncanny valley.

### 3. Foundational Ethical Theories
*   **Decision**: Cover both historical (Asimov) and contemporary (IEEE) frameworks, highlighting their evolution and practical application.
*   **Key Concepts to Cover**:
    *   Asimov's Laws of Robotics: Original laws, limitations, modern critiques.
    *   Modern Roboethics Frameworks: IEEE Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in AI and Autonomous Systems (e.g., General Principles).
    *   Ethical decision-making for roboticists.

### 4. Bias Mitigation Strategies in Embodied AI
*   **Decision**: Detail specific examples of bias and actionable strategies for equitable design.
*   **Key Concepts to Cover**:
    *   Sources of Bias: Data bias, algorithmic bias, design bias (voice, gender, race, culture in appearance/gait).
    *   Impact of Bias: Exclusion, harm, perpetuation of stereotypes.
    *   Mitigation Strategies: Inclusive design principles, diverse datasets, transparency, co-design with diverse communities.

## Technical Context (Documentation)
*   **Platform**: Docusaurus (Markdown/MDX).
*   **Target Audience**: Robotics researchers, engineers, designers, ethicists.
*   **Purpose**: Educate on ethical considerations in humanoid robotics.
