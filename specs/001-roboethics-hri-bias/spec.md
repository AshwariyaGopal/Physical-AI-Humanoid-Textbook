# Feature Specification: Roboethics, HRI, and Bias

**Feature Branch**: `001-roboethics-hri-bias`
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Generate content for 'docs/Module-6-Ethical-and-Legal-Embodiment-ELSI/Week-8-Ethical-Frameworks'. Focus on: 1. **Anthropomorphism and the Uncanny Valley** in HRI. 2. **Roboethics Frameworks** (e.g., Asimov's Laws, modern critiques, IEEE principles). 3. **Bias and Equity in Design** (voice, gait, and appearance)."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Understanding Anthropomorphism and the Uncanny Valley (Priority: P1)

The reader desires to understand the concepts of anthropomorphism and the uncanny valley in the context of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), including their psychological effects and implications for robot design.

**Why this priority**: Fundamental understanding for ethical robot design and user acceptance.

**Independent Test**: The reader can articulate the definitions of anthropomorphism and the uncanny valley, and explain their relevance to HRI based on the chapter content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the chapter content, **When** asked to define anthropomorphism, **Then** the reader provides an accurate definition.
2.  **Given** the chapter content, **When** asked to explain the uncanny valley, **Then** the reader describes the phenomenon and its visual representation.
3.  **Given** the chapter content, **When** presented with a robot design scenario, **Then** the reader can identify potential risks or benefits related to the level of anthropomorphism.

### User Story 2 - Comprehending Roboethics Frameworks (Priority: P1)

The reader seeks to comprehend various established and contemporary frameworks for roboethics, critically evaluating their principles and applicability to real-world robot development.

**Why this priority**: Essential for guiding ethical considerations in the design and deployment of robotic systems.

**Independent Test**: The reader can identify and describe at least two different roboethics frameworks, outlining their core tenets and providing a modern critique.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the chapter content, **When** asked about Asimov's Laws, **Then** the reader can state the laws and discuss their limitations.
2.  **Given** the chapter content, **When** asked to summarize a modern roboethics framework (e.g., IEEE principles), **Then** the reader can outline its key principles.
3.  **Given** the chapter content, **When** presented with an ethical dilemma involving a robot, **Then** the reader can relate it to relevant principles from a discussed framework.

### User Story 3 - Identifying Bias and Promoting Equity in Design (Priority: P1)

The reader aims to identify potential sources of bias in humanoid robot design (e.g., voice, gait, appearance) and learn principles for creating more equitable and inclusive robotic systems.

**Why this priority**: Crucial for mitigating societal harms and ensuring fair and equitable impact of robotics technology.

**Independent Test**: The reader can identify at least three potential sources of bias in humanoid robot design (e.g., related to voice, gait, or appearance) and propose principles for equitable design.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the chapter content, **When** asked about bias in robot voice design, **Then** the reader can provide examples of potential biases.
2.  **Given** the chapter content, **When** asked about bias in robot gait or appearance, **Then** the reader can discuss how design choices can perpetuate stereotypes.
3.  **Given** the chapter content, **When** tasked with outlining principles for equitable robot design, **Then** the reader can list actionable guidelines.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The chapter MUST define anthropomorphism and the uncanny valley in HRI clearly and concisely.
-   **FR-002**: The chapter MUST present and critically discuss at least two distinct roboethics frameworks, including Asimov's Laws and modern approaches (e.g., IEEE P7000 series).
-   **FR-003**: The chapter MUST explain how biases can be embedded in humanoid robot design, specifically concerning voice, gait, and appearance.
-   **FR-004**: The chapter MUST propose principles or guidelines for designing equitable and inclusive humanoid robots.

### Key Entities

-   **Anthropomorphism**: Attribution of human characteristics to non-human entities.
-   **Uncanny Valley**: Phenomenon where highly realistic robots/likenesses evoke revulsion.
-   **Roboethics Frameworks**: Structured approaches to ethical considerations in robotics.
-   **Bias in Design**: Unintended or intended prejudices reflected in robot characteristics.
-   **Equity in Design**: Principles for fair and inclusive robot design.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: After reading, 90% of readers can correctly define anthropomorphism and the uncanny valley.
-   **SC-002**: After reading, 85% of readers can outline the core principles of at least two roboethics frameworks.
-   **SC-003**: After reading, 80% of readers can identify at least three sources of bias in robot design (voice, gait, appearance) and suggest a counteracting principle.
