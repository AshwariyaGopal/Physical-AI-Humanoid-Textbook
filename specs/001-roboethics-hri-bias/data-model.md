# Data Model: Week 8 Ethical Frameworks (ELSI)

## Learning Object (Chapter Structure)

### 1. Introduction: The Humanoid Conundrum
*   **Goal**: Briefly introduce the ethical and societal challenges posed by advanced humanoid robots.
*   **Key Concept**: The need for proactive ethical consideration in design and deployment.

### 2. Psychological Impact: Anthropomorphism and the Uncanny Valley in HRI
*   **Learning Goal**: Understand how human-like robots impact perception and interaction.
*   **Sub-sections**:
    *   **2.1. Anthropomorphism**: Definition, examples, benefits (e.g., ease of interaction) and risks (e.g., false expectations, deception).
    *   **2.2. The Uncanny Valley**: Phenomenon description, psychological theories behind it (e.g., categorization difficulty, threat detection), implications for design.
    *   **2.3. Design Principles**: Strategies for navigating the uncanny valley and promoting positive HRI.

### 3. Foundational Roboethics Frameworks
*   **Learning Goal**: Evaluate historical and contemporary ethical frameworks for robotics.
*   **Sub-sections**:
    *   **3.1. Asimov's Laws of Robotics**: Original laws, their intent, and why they are insufficient for modern AI (e.g., ambiguity, conflict resolution, autonomy).
    *   **3.2. Modern Critiques and Principles**: Discussion of ethical principles from bodies like the IEEE Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in AI and Autonomous Systems (e.g., well-being, accountability, transparency).
    *   **3.3. Beyond Principles**: Introduction to ethical reasoning methods (e.g., deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics) in the context of robotics.

### 4. Bias and Equity in Design
*   **Learning Goal**: Identify sources of bias in humanoid design and develop strategies for equitable design.
*   **Sub-sections**:
    *   **4.1. Sources of Bias**:
        *   **Voice**: Gendered voices, perceived roles, cultural stereotypes.
        *   **Gait**: Masculine/feminine gait, cultural associations.
        *   **Appearance**: Race, gender, age, cultural aesthetics, perpetuating stereotypes.
    *   **4.2. Impact of Unjust Design**: Exclusion, discrimination, reinforcement of harmful stereotypes.
    *   **4.3. Bias Mitigation Strategies**: Inclusive design methodologies, diverse design teams, participatory design, critical assessment of training data, context-aware deployment.

## Entities
*   **Anthropomorphic Robot**: A robot that resembles human form or exhibits human-like characteristics.
*   **Uncanny Valley Effect**: The phenomenon where human replicas that appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit feelings of eeriness and revulsion.
*   **Roboethics**: The ethics of robotics, including ethical principles, frameworks, and guidelines for the design, development, and deployment of robots.
*   **Algorithmic Bias**: Systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create unfair outcomes, such as favoring one group over others.
*   **Equitable Design**: Design practices that ensure fair and just outcomes for all users, considering diverse backgrounds and needs.
